# Machine-Learning
This repository contains my assignments, tasks and projects in the Machine Learning PreMasters Course.

Found in this repository are some notebooks for Supervised Learning Models such as Linear Regression, KNN and Support Vector Machines as well as Unsupervised Learning Clustering Project. 
The clustering project has a detailed comparison of the performance of more than one clustering technique such as K-means, Density Based Clustering, Hierarchial Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models on three different datasets with insightful comments.
